"""The model call.

One function, one job: take a conversation, stream back the assistant's reply.

Everything provider-specific lives in environment variables, so switching from
OpenAI to Azure to a self-hosted model is a config change, not a code change.
That property matters more than it looks like it does right now -- see the
"Where does this live?" section of the README.
