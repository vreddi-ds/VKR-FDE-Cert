Describe patterns, not specifics. "On-prem OpenShift, images from an internal
registry, no public egress" is useful to everyone and identifies nobody. Never
put real hostnames, IPs, or architecture diagrams in this file.

## Week 1 — the first eight questions

<!-- Answered in TC1 Step 6. Bring these back from a real conversation. -->

**Who did you ask?** (role, not name)

<!-- your answer here -->

| # | Question | Answer |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Where do internal apps run? (k8s, ECS, App Service, a VM someone maintains) | <!-- --> |
| 2 | Which cloud? AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem, several? | <!-- --> |
| 3 | Is there an internal container registry? | <!-- --> |
| 4 | How do users log in? (Okta, Entra ID, Ping, SAML, homegrown) | <!-- --> |
| 5 | Can the app reach the internet? Egress proxy? Allowlist? | <!-- --> |
| 6 | Where do secrets come from? (Vault, Secrets Manager, Key Vault) | <!-- --> |
| 7 | Who approves a deployment, and what review does it need? | <!-- --> |
| 8 | Is there an approved internal LLM endpoint already? | <!-- --> |

**What surprised you?**

## Week 1 — what your machine told you

<!--
  Paste the egress probe output from Session 1 here. It is evidence, and it
  frequently disagrees with what people believe about their own network.

| host | why | status | signed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| pypi.org | Python packages | OK | GlobalSign nv-sa |
| files.pythonhosted.org | the actual wheel downloads | OK | GlobalSign nv-sa |
| api.openai.com | the model API | OK | Google Trust Services |
| cdn.jsdelivr.net | the CDN the Week 1 frontend uses | OK | GlobalSign nv-sa |
| huggingface.co | open weights, Weeks 2 and 8 | OK | Amazon |
| registry-1.docker.io | container images | OK | Amazon |
| github.com | this repository | OK | Sectigo Limited |

**Verdict:** Open network, public CAs, no proxy. Nothing here will bite you.

**Does this match what you were told in the table above?** Where it doesn't, that
gap is worth chasing — it usually means a proxy nobody documented.

## Week 9 — the full checklist

<!--
  TC9 extends this same file. Do not start a new one: the point is that the git
  history shows one continuous piece of work from Week 1 to Week 9.
